A Vanilla JS app that allows keep track of the monthly budged based on Incomes and Expenses.

App still work in progress


**Disclaimer:**<br>
App coded following and understanding the tutorial on https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

For learning purposes I changed (and keep changing as long as I keep working in it) part of the code to my will.

Here some examples of changes I applied to the author's code:
- I translated many parts of the app into ES6+
- Instead of using the js JavaScript String `replace()` method I used template ${strings} (less code and easier to read)
- Simplified `forEach` with minimal needed parameters
